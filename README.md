# Dynamic Icon Export

A Figma plugin to export multiple frames as an SVG with a single path. No need to manually clone the frame, detach the instances, outline the vectors and flatten them, Dynamic Icon Export does this for you without modifying the original frame, so you can still edit the icon in the future.
